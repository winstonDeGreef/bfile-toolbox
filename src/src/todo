todo
[x] create tabs with stdout, stderr and status
[x] create statusStore that contains a textfield with status data generated by a function for each function type
[x] statusStore should have a stop button
[x] status for explicit: order should not matter
  [x] computed
  [x] length
  [x] computed sequential
  [x] output data list
[x] status for list
  [x] computed
  [x] length
[x] for list add size algorithms
  [x] linear algorithm with start and increment
  [x] preset algorithm
  [x] generate these client side and use these to provide a bettor error message in handleStdLine when two different arrays provide different values
[x] for list, output calculated each time list is finished
  [x] if values change, show user error
[ ] make parisizemax and ?parisize? (probbably dont need to set this) configurable
[ ] truncate bfile output
[ ] edit bfiles after being created
[ ] warn if edited by user note is added but no edits have been made
[ ] warn if bfile generated is out of date
[ ]verify against data
[ ] verify against pervious bfile
[ ] add a_vector as synomym for lista
[ ] fix bug that you cant edit main function input
[ ] max container width
[ ] bug with lista length cutoff? https://oeis.org/edit?seq=A354015
[ ] stop button submits form

[ ] find bfiles with invalid type
[x] fix server error (only added a bypass)
[ ] python support
[ ] lookup values of other sequences
[ ] automatically save bfile
[ ] automatically gen bfile
[ ] rename run2 button to run

[ ] include warning whenever {{TEMPLATE}} syntax is used in user user suppliad input
[ ] add documentation in page
[ ] linear list guess algorithm will round down to 10 000 explain this to user
[ ] allow arbitrary max offset 
 [ ] (check parseCustomGuessesTextAndUpdate) validity checks
[ ] for custom guess add line error output
[ ] maybe improve customguess line diagnostics?

[ ] loop function type that gives all the controll to the fuction
[ ] check line length client side
[ ] (LANG) should be case insensitive
[ ]even if error, dont discard data
